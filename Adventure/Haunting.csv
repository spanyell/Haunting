1,1,1,With a gasp* you open your eyes. You lay on a canopy bed* the curtains drawn. It is dark* save for the intermittent flashes of lightning. You are above the covers* though judging how stiff you feel* it is obvious you have been sleeping for some time. You had been dreaming* though with each passing second* it fades. Who are you? Where are you?,Rise and open the curtains.*Try to remember your dream.*Try to remember who you are.,FALSE,OneFourOneView()*OneTwoOneView()*OneThreeOneView()
1,2,1,The events of the dreams are vague* as all dreams are* but you remember the need to move quickly. You wanted to run with a great desperation in your heart* but it felt as though you were getting nowhere. Was someone or something chasing you? You cannot be certain.

You were overcome with fear in the moments before you awoke* but the dream has faded before you can recall what.,Rise and open the curtains.*Try to remember who you are.,FALSE,OneFourOneView()*OneThreeOneView()
1,3,1,While it first* you find it silly to question your identity* it remains elusive.

1,4,1,You open the curtains of the canopy bed and drop your legs to a carpeted floor. When you stand* you feel a sudden light-headedness. Your skin feels cold and clammy. You fight the urge to sit back down.,Continue,FALSE,OneFiveOneView()
1,5,1,A flash of lightning lights the room* its thunder shaking you to your very core. A window is in front of you* with heavy rain pounding on the glass. It is a large bedroom with a high ceiling. There is a dresser and vanity mirror against the far wall to the right* a large armoire to the left.

1,6,4,A single bulb switches on above a tall sink with two faucets. You see a claw footed tub and a toilet with a pull chain. The floor is checkered with black and white square tiles* the walls of simple white plaster.,Try the sink.*Flush the toilet.*Peer into the tub.*Head back to the bedroom.,FALSE,OneSixFourView()*OneSixFiveView()*OneSixSixView()*OneSixNineView()

1,6,7,Your hands grip the side of the tub* peering into absolute darkness. You feel uneasy* as if there is a presence behind you.,Quickly turn around.*Close your eyes and wait for the feeling to pass.,FALSE,OneSixSevenView()*OneSixEightView()
1,6,8,You turn yourself around. For a second you think you see…A flash of lightning blinds you. Thunder roars. There is a low pop as the bathroom bulb burns out.,Go back to the bedroom.,FALSE,OneSixTenView()
1,6,9,You close your eyes* hoping that whatever you’re feeling is just in your head. You can swear you hear breathing behind you. Your eyes remain closed. Your heart pounds. Suddenly* there is a roar of thunder and a pop. When you open your eyes once more* you find yourself in a suffocating darkness.,Go back to the bedroom.,FALSE,OneSixTenView()

1,8,1,In the dim light you are able to spot a light switch next to the large door. You turn the switch on. An ornate glass light fixture hanging from the ceiling illuminates the room. The rug is red* matching the red flowers on the expensive wallpaper* as well as the curtains of the canopy bed. There is a certain familiarity about the room* though you cannot say for certain that you hold any specific memory of it. On the floor* between the vanity and the large door* is a hardcover book that is face down.,Try the smaller door.*Look out the window.*Pick up the book.,FALSE,OneSixOneView()*OneNineOneView()*OneTenOneView()

1,10,1,You reach down to pick up the book* or rather merely the hardcover binding of what was once a book.
